Import the data set to R correctly and assign player names as rownames of the data frame

```{r}
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
mydata <- read_excel("./data_Eurobasket_2025.xlsx")
rownames(mydata) <- mydata$PLAYER
```

Check the structure of the data and assign correct type to each variable considering whether it is a categorical or numerical variable.
